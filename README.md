# Taskey-React
Simple Task/To dos app built with React, using Firebase for Google Auth Login and Database

Its a simple web app to manage your daily tasks or to dos.

It uses latest ES6, ES7 and ES8 JS, that means arrow functions, rest / spread etc.

It also uses React 16.3 +. 

It has stateless functional components, uses ES6 Class to extend React.Component.

I was thinking of trying to use the new React Context, but i decided against it as this is just a simple app, we only have a few components
and passing down functions and data is not hard using props when we only have one state that rests on top of our main App component.


Feel free to download, mess with it, update it and do whatever you want with it. It might have some errors and bugs, 
but there is only so much one can discover and fix without proper testing.
